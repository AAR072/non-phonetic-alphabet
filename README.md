Ever get a call from s scammer or annoying telemarketer?  Don’t hang up, give them fake information.  When you need to spell something, make it harder.  Instead of “A as in Alpha, X as in X-Ray” say “A as in are, X as in xenon”.

 

Here’s a list of possibilities.  There are more than one option for each letter.  Hopefully they get confused and you need to elaborate.  “No, No, not ‘r’, A as in Aisle, A as in Aural.”

There are several tricks here.  One is to use homophones like Hour, Our, Are; best used together in the same word.  Some are a reference to a different thing that is non-obvious until explained like saying sleep when you mean “ZZZ”.  Another is silent letter like “Gnat”.  The most common is non-phonetic consonant combinations like “Chasm”.
